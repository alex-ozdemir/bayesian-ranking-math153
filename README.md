bayesian-ranking-math153
========================

A numerical, purely Bayesian ranking algorithm written in Java.

This was the code behind my final project for Math 153 : Bayesian Statistics at Harvey Mudd College.
My goal was to design a ranking algorithm using Bayesian methodology from the ground up.
This was inspired by Microsoft's TrueSkill algorithm, which is based in Bayesian statistics
 but deviates from Bayesian methods in order to improve performance.
The algorithm is written in Java.
