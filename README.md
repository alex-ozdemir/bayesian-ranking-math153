bayesian-ranking-math153
========================

A numerical, purely Bayesian ranking algorithm written in Java.

This was the code behind my final project for Math 153 : Bayesian Statistics at Harvey Mudd College.
My goal was to design a ranking algorithm using Bayesian methodology from the ground up.
This was inspired by Microsoft's TrueSkill algorithm, the base of which is based on Bayesian
methods, but deviates very slightly in some areas to imrove performance (Making it dramatically
more effective).
The algorithm is written in Java.
